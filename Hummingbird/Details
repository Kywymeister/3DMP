# Project Name

Hummingbird Mechanism


# Description

       The hummingbird mechanism allows the movement of multiple separate components, from a single cogwheel.       


# How the mechanism works

       The mechanism has two main movements :
       The body back-and-forth motion is directly linked to the Front Base Cogwheel, a full motion of the cogwheel
resulting in a full completed motion of the body, due to the Legs being directly connected to the Front Base Cogwheel,
       The wings motion is done with multiple cogwheels continuing from the Front Base Cogwheel, along the Holder, then
the Body, finally connecting to the shoulder through the Shoulder Wheel - Shoulder connector, which determines the movement
of the wings.


#Software Used

Autodesk Fusion 360


# Moving the mechanism
To power the mechanism you should power the Base Front Cogwheel joint,

# Chronology

Week 2 V11 - Components nearly done
Week 3 V23 - Joints for body done, joints for wings not placed.
       V26 - All joints placed, front- back motion working, wings are not moving => nothing is moving due
             to motion links, some joints may be conflicting.
       V29 - Shoulders redesigned to eliminate possible wrong contact between Shoulder and Shoulder Wheel to Shoulder Connector.
             After joints were placed, wings are still not moving, motion link for the Shoulder Wheel to Shoulder connector doesn't
             compensate for the tilting of the Shoulder during the rotation => the pivot doesn't rotate => nothing happens.
